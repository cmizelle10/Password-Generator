# Password Generator

## Description

This application allows an employee to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data </br>
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria </br>
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security </br>

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password </br>
WHEN I click the button to generate a password </br>
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria </br>
WHEN prompted for password criteria </br>
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password </br>
WHEN prompted for the length of the password </br>
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters </br>
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password </br>
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters </br>
WHEN I answer each prompt </br>
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected </br>
WHEN all prompts are answered </br>
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria </br>
WHEN the password is generated </br>
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page 

## Installation

The only thing needed for this project is an environment to write HTML, CSS and Javscript code such as VS code.

## Usage

When the page loads, first click the "Generate Password" button. You will then be prompted to specify your desired character length. You will then be prompted for a series of further password specifications such as including upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters. You will then see a randomly generated password that meets the specifications you just provided.
